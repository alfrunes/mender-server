# mender-server
Mender Server monorepo

## Getting started

Before you start the Mender server, make sure you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
Mender server requires Docker Compose version `v2.23.1` or newer.
```
docker compose version
```

You will also need to update your local DNS or host rewrites, for example by appending to `/etc/hosts`:
```bash
echo '127.0.0.1   docker.mender.io s3.docker.mender.io' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

> [!NOTE]
> This docker composition is only meant for evaluation purposes.
> Please use [the helm chart](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-helm) in production environments.

To start evaluating Mender, you can bring up your Mender server by running:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Once all containers are running, you can create your initial user using the following command:
```
MENDER_USERNAME=admin@docker.mender.io
MENDER_PASSWORD=password123
docker compose exec useradm useradm create-user --username "$MENDER_USERNAME" --password "$MENDER_PASSWORD"
```

Visit [https://localhost](https://localhost) and sign in using the credentials from the snippet above.

### Adding a virtual client

To add a virtual client with the composition, run the following command:
```bash
docker compose run -d client
```
